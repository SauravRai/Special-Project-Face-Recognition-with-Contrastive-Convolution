# Special-Project-Face-Recognition-with-Contrastive-Convolution
This repository contains the Pytorch implementation of the paper Face Recognition with Contrastive Convolution, 
Chunrui Han, Meina Kan, Xilin Chen published in ECCV 2018.

# REQUIREMENTS
1. PyTorch 0.4.1
2. Numpy
3. Sklearn

For running: the above implementation you need
(1) The preprocessed CASIA webface dataset 
(2) The Preproccesd LFW dataset
In the end you have to set the path of the dataset wherever required
