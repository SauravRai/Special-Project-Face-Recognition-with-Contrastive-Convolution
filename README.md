Chunrui Han, Meina Kan, Xilin Chen published in ECCV 2018.

For running: the above implementation you need
(1) The pretrained lightcnn 4 model pytorch version.
(2) The preprocessed CASIA webface dataset 
(3) The Preproccesd LFW dataset
#In the end you have to set the path of the dataset wherever required
